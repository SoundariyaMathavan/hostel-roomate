# Migration Instructions

There was an issue with the database schema where the `is_paid` field was missing from the `hostel_booking` table. This has been fixed by adding a proper migration file.

## How to Apply the Migration

### Option 1: Using Django's manage.py

Run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Option 2: Using the provided script

Run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
python apply_migrations.py
```

## Verifying the Migration

After applying the migration, the `is_paid` field should be available in the `hostel_booking` table. You can verify this by:

1. Checking if the checkout page loads without errors
2. Checking if payments can be processed correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the migration:

1. Check the migration files in `hostel/migrations/` to ensure they are properly ordered
2. Make sure the database is writable
3. If using SQLite, ensure the database file is not locked by another process

If problems persist, you may need to:

1. Back up your data
2. Delete the database file (if using SQLite)
3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to recreate the database with all migrations# Migration Instructions
